This is a repository made for Helion SA team leader.

Here I am going to save my excersise files. 

Everything I was testing on localhost using XAMPP because when I wanted to display the table from json file
I was getting errors in the console and data was not visible. 

First error: "Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP."

Second error: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///Users/wiktor/Desktop/helion/books.json due to access control checks."

The problem is that if using getJSON you want to send GET request and for that you have to have the website on some sever.
